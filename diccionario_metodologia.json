        "Addressing the RQ: Effectiveness of LLM-generated text detectors": "Here are the principal ideas from this text:\n\n1. A detector is only useful if it is reasonably effective in detecting LLM-generated texts.\n2. The effectiveness of a detector can be measured by three metrics: accuracy, false positives, and resilience.\n3. Accuracy refers to how well the detector identifies LLM-generated texts, with two methods used: averaging predictions across a dataset and calculating the proportion of correctly-classified texts.\n4. False positives refer to original submissions that are suspected as being generated by an LLM text detector. Fewer false positives are preferred.\n5.

        "Models": "The principal ideas of this text can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Concerns about LLM-generated text**: The author expresses concerns about the potential misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs) in academic settings, highlighting the risk of undermining academic trust and intellectual merit.\n2. **Erosion of critical thinking**: The abundance of readily available machine-generated \"knowledge\" may foster a culture of intellectual dependence, leading to a loss of skills such as critical evaluation, independent thought, and original argumentation.\n3. **Detecting LLM-generated text**: Developing robust methods for detecting LLM-generated text is an ethical imperative to safeguard the pursuit of genuine understanding, honest inquiry, and the independent construction of knowledge.\n4. **DistilBERT as a promising tool**: The author suggests that DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT, can be used to efficiently and accurately detect LLM-generated text.\n5. **Experimental setup**: The text describes two datasets (LLM - Detect AI Generated Text and DAIGT-V3 Train Dataset) and the software setup used in the study, including preprocessing steps for the text data.\n6. **Methodology**: The author outlines the methodology used to develop a model for detecting LLM-generated text using DistilBERT, including its architecture, training process, and classification process.\n\nOverall, the text highlights the importance of developing methods to detect LLM-generated text to maintain academic integrity and promote critical thinking.",
        "Metrics of Evaluation": "The main ideas in this text are:\n\n1. The performance of a model is evaluated using four key metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.\n2. These metrics are calculated based on True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN) values derived from the model's predictions.\n3. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.\n4. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, indicating the model's ability to correctly identify positive instances.\n5. Recall (also known as sensitivity) measures the proportion of actual positive instances that were correctly identified, indicating the model's ability to detect all positive instances.\n6. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, giving equal weight to both metrics. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect performance and 0 indicating poor performance.\n7. The F1 score is a balanced metric that takes into account both false positives and false negatives, making it suitable for imbalanced datasets.\n8. Using these metrics provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance."

A higher `U(p)` indicates better performance.\n5. **Template-based prompts**: The constructed prompt serves as a template, allowing users to insert different task inputs (highlighted in purple text).",

After optimization, construct a new prompt using the optimized in-context output.\n6. **Prompt Construction**: Construct a new prompt by combining the extracted features with the task instruction and the optimized in-context outputs.\n\nThese ideas are part of an algorithm called SICO (Semantically-Informed Contextual Optimization) that aims to improve language generation models by optimizing prompts and generating human-like text.",
        "SICO for Paraphrasing": "Here are the principal ideas from the text:\n\n1. The SICO-Gen approach directly generates a task output to evade detectors.\n2. SICO can be adapted for paraphrasing, referred to as SICO-Para, which evades detectors in two steps: generating an intermediate output and then paraphrasing it.\n3. To switch from SICO-Gen to SICO-Para, only two adjustments are needed:\n\t* Set the task input x to the AI-generated output text in both D and X_eval.\n\t* Modify the task instruction p_task to a paraphrasing instruction."
